# Theia

Theia is a network observability and analytics platform for Kubernetes. It is
built on top of [Antrea](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea), and consumes
[network flows exported by Antrea](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/blob/main/docs/network-flow-visibility.md)
to provide fine-grained visibility into the communication and NetworkPolicies
among Pods and Services in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Theia is simple. You can follow the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)
guide to install Theia and start rocking!

Theia supports network flow visualization and monitoring with Grafana. Check the
[Network Flow Visibility](docs/network-flow-visibility.md) document to learn
more.

Based on the collected network flow information, Theia can recommend appropriate
NetworkPolicy configuration to secure Kubernetes network and applications.
Please refer to the [NetworkPolicy Recommendation](docs/networkpolicy-recommendation.md)
user guide to learn more.
