	Use:   "theia-sf",
	Short: "Manage infrastructure to use Theia with Snowflake backend",
	Long: `Theia can use Snowflake as the data store for flows exported by
the Flow Aggregator in each cluster running Antrea. You need to bring your own
Snowflake account and your own AWS account. This CLI application takes care of
configuring cloud resources in Snowflake and AWS to enable Theia. To get
started:

1. ensure that AWS credentials are available:
   https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#specifying-credentials
2. export your Snowflake credentials as environment variables:
   SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT, SNOWFLAKE_USER, SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD
3. choose an AWS S3 bucket which will be used to store infrastructure state;
   you can create one with "theia-sf create-bucket" if needed
4. choose an AWS KMS key which will be used to encrypt infrastructure state;
   you can create one with "theia-sf create-kms-key" if needed
5. provision infrastructure with:
   "theia-sf onboard --bucket-name <YOUR BUCKET NAME> --key-id <YOUR KMS KEY ID>"`,
